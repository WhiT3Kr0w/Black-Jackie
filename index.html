				<strong>Black Jackie</strong><br />
				<p>
					This is a simple Black Jack game that I made to practise a bit Javascript and jQuery.<br />
					It is far from perfect and probably has a few bugs :).<br />
					If you wish you can get the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/WhiT3Kr0w/Black-Jackie" target="_blank">Black Jackie github repo</a>. <br />
					If you see any errors or want to give some feedback or advice, please let me know.<br />
					Feel free to use any bits of my code. Just give me a nudge so I can feel proud someone is using some of my code.  ;)<br />
				</p>
				<strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
				<p>
					This is a simple Black Jack game, US style.<br />
					The purpose of the game is to make bets and try to win some money each hand dealt.<br />
					To win a hand you will need to get as close to 21 points as possible, without exceeding 21. If you get 22 or more you are busted and lose the hand.<br />
					Aces can count as 1 or 11 points, Jacks, Queens and Kings count as 10 points and the remaining cards are counted as their numeric value.<br />
				</p><p>
					Before starting don't forget to check the bet amount.<br />
					Initially the dealer will deal 2 cards for you and 2 for him. Only one of his cards will be visible.<br />
					You will then choose to get more cards or Stand.<br />
					The dealer will play his hand after you choose to Stand or if you bust.<br />
					He will get more cards until he reaches at least 17 points or busts. If he gets 17 he will stop there.<br />
					The one that has the closest to 21 points without exceeding will win the game.<br />
				</p><p>
					A blackjack or natural hand is when the first two cards total 21 points.<br />
					You, or the dealer, will win automatically with a Blackjack, in case the other one doesn't get one as well.<br />
					If you both have a Blackjack then it is a tie/draw, also know as a push.<br />
					21 points done in the third or later card does not count as a Blackjack.<br />					
				</p><p>
					If both of you bust you will lose your bet. The 'house' has advantage.
					If you win you will get the same amount as your bet.
					If you lose, you will get the sum of your bet taken from your money stack.
					If you get a Blackjack you will be paid a 3/2 rate. Which means you will get 150% of your bet. If you bet 5, you will win 7.5.
